Thank you for your interest in *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*.

Please refer to the [availability page](http://jgte.github.io/zambujeira/en/#disponibilidade) to check if *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte* vacant during the period you are staying at Zambujeira.

Reservation
-----------

If you would like to reserve *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*, [please contact me by email, phone or SMS](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#house-contacts). A reservation does not assure you access to the house. That is only done by confirming. Any other client may reserve in an overlapping period. If that is the case, I will contact you immediately. The client who makes the rent cost payment first (date of arrival of the funds to the bank account below) has his/her reservation confirmed and the other client's reservation is nullified.

Confirmation
------------

Your reservation is only confirmed after receiving the renting cost in the following bank account:

    IBAN: PT50 0033 0000 0978 0310 2702 9
    BIC/SWIFT: BCOMPTPL

Please consider the bank transfer delays (1 day for Portuguese banks, 4 or 5 days for international transfers). You will not be able to access to the house before the funds have been received, *no exceptions*. Please use the *send confirmation by email* feature of your on-line banking, if possible, to inform me that the transaction has been initiated.

Cancellation
------------

You may cancel your stay at any time before the start of the renting period and the renting cost will be returned to you in full. If there was another overlapping reservation, the refunded cost will be reduced according to the length of the overlapping period (at the flat rate of 150 euro per day).

After you start your stay, if you are not satisfied, you will be refunded the full cost minus 100 euro for cleaning and 150 euro for each night you stayed. Therefore, on the day of arrival, if you decide not to stay at the house, the renting cost will be refunded minus 100 euro.


Receipt
-------

I will issue a receipt to you on the last day of the renting period, through the Portuguese tax office website (*Portal das Finan√ßas*).

Please provide me with your tax number, so I can add it to the receipt.
