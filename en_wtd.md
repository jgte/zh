# Getting there

The following instructions assume you are travelling from Lisbon. Another option is to fly to Faro and rent a car from there. Public transport from Faro to Zambujeira is not easy, since you need to do a stop-over at Lagos.

Let me know if you need help travelling form locations other than Lisbon.

## Car

1. Take the **Vasco da Gama** bridge on **A12** motorway. You can also take the **25 de Abril** bridge (the one that looks like the Golden Gate bridge in S. Francisco), but that means you need to cross Lisbon, if you're coming from the airport

2. Exit the **A12** to **A2**, following signs **Sul / Algarve**.

3. Exit **A2**, to **IP8/Sines/Santiago/Grândola**.

4. Follow **IP8** road for about 45 km until you find the section of motorway **A26**.

5. Exit the **A26** towards **St. André / Odemira**, go around the roundabout and exit towards **Algarve / Cercal / Vila Nova Milfontes**.

6. Follow the **Cercal** sign towards the second plate, which indicates **Porto Covo**.

7. Keep following the signs to **Porto Covo / Vila Nova de Milfontes**.

8. Before arriving at **Vila Nova de Milfontes**, there's a large roundabout. Follow towards South (straight, don't take the right exit, into **Vila Nova de Milfontes**). You will soon cross a large bridge with an amazing view of the mouth of river Mira.

9. Turn right at the sign **Cabo Sardão / Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer since you need to go to **Odemira**).

10. After 2 km turn left into **Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer, since you need to go to **Cavaleiro**).

11. After 5 km, you come across a junction, take the right towards **Zambujeira**. Keep going straight and ignore the left turn towards **S. Teotónio**.

12. At the end of roughly 1 km of straight road going West, you'll be in **Zambujeira**. Go straight until you can only take a right turn, towards North.

13. Take the first left turn, towards West; you should be seeing the ocean at a distance.

14. Keep going straight until you find a roundabout, take the right exit, going North.

15. After 20m, there's a crossing and one house further you'll see [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address) on the right. It's a bit confusing that the first house on the corner is nr. 3, while [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address) is further down the street and it's nr. 1. That's how things work in Alentejo sometimes.

A map of this route can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/ZKu7BLoePPE2).


## Bus

The cheapest way to get to Zambujeira is by bus. They depart from [**Sete Rios** bus terminal](https://goo.gl/maps/BkjK65p9Zmv), which is easily accessible by Lisbon's subway (which also connects directly to the airport).

The buses depart daily at:

* 7:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 8:30 (only between 15 July and 31 August)
* 10:30 (between 1 September and 20 June, only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays)
* 13:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 17:00

Be sure the check the schedules at the website of [*Rede Expressos*](http://www.rede-expressos.pt/) (the company operating the bus lines).

The bus stop in Zambujeira is [300 m away](https://goo.gl/maps/JDVFLLizMt32) from [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address), at a perfectly reasonable walking distance, even with (wheeled) luggage.

If you know the date of your return to Lisbon, buy a return ticket, saving you some money. If you need to buy the return ticket in Zambujeira, go to [Pastelaria Doce Tentação](https://goo.gl/maps/c7x2aZApEPN2), they have a sales point there.

# Parking

Park the car on the street, in front of the house. It is not possible to park the car in the driveway south of the house. During the summer, there are many cars and it might not be easy to park in front of the house. There are, however, many parking places in the surrounding streets.

# Festival Sudoeste

At the start of August, the [Festival Sudoeste](http://www.meosudoeste.pt) takes place [2 km away](https://goo.gl/maps/tiTbq2ufZS82) from Zambujeira do Mar. It's huge! There's a tsunami of festival-goers and it's difficult to stay oblivious to this event. Restaurants are always full, the beach is over-crowded and most people who traditionally take vacations in Zambujeira go somewhere else during this period.

I repeat: **this event it not something you can ignore** if you are in Zambujeira, or anywhere near it. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is not a good time to come to Zambujeira. Although it is taking place a few kilometres away, it brings in many people (hundreds of thousands of them) and traffic.

Check out [some pictures in Google](https://www.google.pt/search?q=festival+sudoeste&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNotn1qN7LAhUF7xQKHVnCAzEQ_AUIBygB) to get an idea of it.

# Weather


The weather during the summer is very pleasant. It never gets too hot because of the sea breeze. During the night, the temperature drops somewhat and it is rare that it remains hot enough to go outside without some kind of coat of pullover. You may wake up to find the village covered by fog. Usually, it clears out at around noon.

Be sure to join scores of people watching the sun set, in the church square or Ilias cape (see the map in the [Useful locations](#useful-locations) section). It is usually quite amazing.

Outside the summer months, the weather tends to be chilly during the night, to the extent of being uncomfortable during winter. Note that there is no heating whatsoever in the [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address). You may find out that the temperature is around 10 degrees from December to February and think it's not too bad. Be aware that the humidity is very high, and it actually feels like 5 degrees less (at least). The available blankets might not be enough to sleep comfortably, so please bring your own (or use spare ones from the other rooms, in case those beds are vacant).
