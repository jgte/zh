# Festival Sudoeste

At the start of August, the [Festival Sudoeste](http://www.meosudoeste.pt) takes place [2 km away](https://goo.gl/maps/tiTbq2ufZS82) from Zambujeira do Mar. It's huge! There's a tsunami of festival-goers and it's difficult to stay oblivious to this event. Restaurants are always full, the beach is over-crowded and most people who traditionally take vacations in Zambujeira go somewhere else during this period.

I repeat: **this event it not something you can ignore** if you are in Zambujeira, or anywhere near it. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is not a good time to come to Zambujeira. Although it is taking place a few kilometres away, it brings in many people (hundreds of thousands of them) and traffic.

Check out [some pictures in Google](https://www.google.pt/search?q=festival+sudoeste&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNotn1qN7LAhUF7xQKHVnCAzEQ_AUIBygB) to get an idea of it.

# Weather


The weather during the summer is very pleasant. It never gets too hot because of the sea breeze. During the night, the temperature drops somewhat and it is rare that it remains hot enough to go outside without some kind of coat of pullover. You may wake up to find the village covered by fog. Usually, it clears out at around noon.

Be sure to join scores of people watching the sun set, in the church square or Ilias cape (see the map in the [Useful locations](#useful-locations) section). It is usually quite amazing.

Outside the summer months, the weather tends to be chilly during the night, to the extent of being uncomfortable during winter. Note that there is no heating whatsoever in the [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address). You may find out that the temperature is around 10 degrees from December to February and think it's not too bad. Be aware that the humidity is very high, and it actually feels like 5 degrees less (at least). The available blankets might not be enough to sleep comfortably, so please bring your own (or use spare ones from the other rooms, in case those beds are vacant).
