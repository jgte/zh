# Arrival

When you arrive in Zambujeira, please contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* so that she shows you the house and hands you the keys. Please arrange in advance with her the time of your arrival, to be sure she is available and to avoid any unnecessary waiting time.

The address of the house is:

    Rua da Fonte 1
    7630-776 Zambujeira do Mar
    Portugal

The GPS coordinates are (from Google maps):

    Latitude 37.5256252, Longitude -8.7868201

Refer to the [Getting there](#getting-there) section to find more details about finding your way to *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*.

# Safety

The village of Zambujeira do Mar is a quiet and peaceful community; robberies are very uncommon. However, during the summer, with the inflow of tourists, it is always a good idea to leave the door locked when absent from the house. Be sure to properly close all windows (including those upstairs).

Do not grant access to the house to anyone, including someone claiming to be me or to be acting on my behalf. The obvious exceptions are your host *Sra. Zina Sirooka*, who you met when you arrived (or anyone accompanying her), and the police (most likely from the [GNR](http://www.gnr.pt) *Guarda Nacional Republicana* -- National Republican Guard -- who wears [characteristic uniforms](https://www.google.pt/search?q=farda+da+guarda+nacional+republicana&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjum6Kdx97LAhWHchQKHY8ZDtYQ_AUIBygB&biw=1358&bih=650)). Less obvious is to allow access to workers from the electricity company [EDP](http://www.edp.pt), who must be wearing a uniform and able to present identification, so that they can read the electricity counter on the wall to the right, immediately after the front door. There is no need to let them any further than the hall next to the front door.

Be aware that the bathtubs (on both toilet rooms) are extremely slippery when wet. Do not climb inside without first setting the rubber mat. If the rubber mat is missing, contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* to get a replacement. Please use the bathtub on the other toilet room until the new rubber mat is available.

On the toilet room of the ground floor, there is first aid supplies to the right, immediately after the front door.

# External areas

You have access to the terrace, the balcony upstairs and the yard in front of the house (between the street and the western wall of the house). The driveway on the south and the yard on the east are only for emergency. The external kitchen door leads to the eastern yard, you can find the key of the lock hanging on the wall to the left of this door. You may also access the gas storage, if needed, see the section on operating the [gas](#gas) supply.

# Appliances

## Stove and oven

The stove and oven in the kitchen are powered by gas. See the section on [gas](#gas) for further details, in case it is not possible to use it. There is no in-built igniter, so you'll need to use the matches or lighters resting on the small shelve on the top left of the stove.

## Dishwasher

1. Load it with dirty dishes in the usual way.
2. Put soap in the compartment (only use dishwasher soap, do not use normal soap, it makes way too much foam and it will spill all over the floor; don't ask me how I know this).
3. Close the lid of the soap compartment.
4. Close the door of the dishwasher.
5. Rotate the button on the top right until you align the mark on he button with the mark on the body. There is only this mark, since the remaining markings are worn out.
7. Turn on the power using the red switch on the multiple power sockets, which is resting on top of the dishwasher, on the far right corner. The red switch will be lit, indicating that electricity is flowing and the microwave will beep (since it too is connected to this multiple power socket). Be sure to disconnect the toaster (by yanking the respective power cord).
6. Pull the button on the dishwasher out. It should start making noises.

## Microwaves and toaster

As mentioned before, there is the need to turn on the switch at the multiple power socket that is resting on the dishwasher before the microwave and toaster can be used. Note that the toaster does not have an off switch, that is effectively done by unplugging it from electricity. If you only want to operate the microwave or the dishwasher, please be sure that the toaster is disconnected from electricity.

## Fridge and freezer

The fridge should be fully operational when you arrive. If that is not the case, check that the power plug is connected to the power socket, on the wall to the left of the fridge.

## Washing machine

1. Load the dirty clothes in the machine (do not over-fill it, otherwise it will not start).
2. Close the glass door.
3. Open the soap container located on the top left of the front panel.
4. Fill the soap and softener compartments, and the chlorine compartment if needed.
5. Close the soap container.
6. Connect the power cord to the power socket on the wall behind the washing machine.
7. Push the round button immediately to the right of the soap container.
8. Rotate the dial to select the appropriate washing program. The following pictures show the meaning of the symbols printed in the washing machine (in Portuguese).
![maquina_de_lavar1](http://jgte.github.io/zh/images/maquina_de_lavar1.png)
![maquina_de_lavar2](http://jgte.github.io/zh/images/maquina_de_lavar2.png)
Blue is for cotton or linen clothes, yellow is for synthetic clothes and black is for delicate or woollen clothes, in decreasing order of program length and washing intensity. The time it takes to finish the program is shown on the led panel at the front of the washing machine.
9. Push the small diamond-shaped button on the far right. After a couple of seconds, it should start making noises.
10. After the program finishes, turn off the machine by pressing the round button, disconnect the power cord from the power socket and open the glass door.

## Coffee machine

1. Make sure there is water in the container located at the back (you may remove this container or fill it while attached).
2. Be sure the machine is plugged in to electricity.
3. Press the button on the left, at the top of the machine. This will turn on the machine, as indicated by the red light next to this button, and it will start heating the water.
4. Open the coffee capsule entry buy flipping up the lid on the front, at the top of the machine. You should hear the previous coffee capsule fall to the collecting container.
5. Insert the new coffee capsule, minding the grooves on the machine and the shape of the capsule. Be sure that it falls as far down as it can go, without pushing with force.
6. Close the lid. You may need to wiggle the lid in order for it to engage the coffee capsule properly.
7. Open the shelve that will hold the coffee cup (if not done already).
8. Place the coffee cup on the shelve.
9. Wait for the green led to be lit, located next to the button on the right, on the top of the machine. This means that the water is sufficiently hot.
10. Press the button next to the green led. Coffee will start flowing.
11. Once you have enough coffee, press the green button. This wills top the flow of coffee.

You can find [the correct coffee capsules](https://www.mydeltaq.com/capsulas.aspx) at the big supermarket in São Teotónio.

## TV

The TV only shows the *open signal* TV stations. They are all Portuguese although you may find programs in English (or any other language for that matter). In Portugal, foreign TV shows are subtitled (except for children shows). The following channels are available:

* [RTP1](http://www.rtp.pt/play/direto/rtp1)
* [RTP2](http://www.rtp.pt/play/direto/rtp2)
* [SIC](http://sic.sapo.pt)
* [TVI](http://www.tvi.iol.pt)

To turn on the TV, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the TV and the decoder (the black box next to the TV) are powered.
2. Pick the remote and press the big red button (standby/on), while pointing the remote to the decoder. The red and green lights start flickering
3. Turn on the TV by touching the on/off light (I have marked this area because it's difficult to see during the day). There should be an image saying that the signal is getting acquired. After 30 seconds or so, the lights in the decoder stop flickering and only the green light will be on. At the time, the TV picture should be seen on the TV.
4. Use the remote to change channels.

If there is no sound, turn off the TV and then turn it on again. If that doesn't work, do the same to the decoder, by pressing the big red button (standby/on) on the decoder.

# Services

## WiFi internet

There is WiFi internet throughout the house. The SSID is *Lajinha* and contact me to get the password. The traffic is limited to 7Gb/month, so it may run out. If that is the case, the internet access is still working but at a much lower speed. During the summer months, the influx of tourists causes the network to overload and the speed might not be as high as expected.

## Bed sheets and towels

Bed sheets and towels are available during your stay. If you need more, please find them in the storage room under the stairs. In case you cannot find them, please contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* so that she can provide you with more.

Additionally, each there are two blankets, one bed cover and (one or two) pillows for each bed. You can find them in the closet of all rooms.

## Laundry

Please contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* if you want some clothes to be washed and/or ironed. Arrange directly with her the payment for this service. The washing of the bed sheets and towels is included in the renting cost.

## Cleaning

Please contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* if you want to have the house cleaned during your stay. Arrange directly with her the payment for this service. The cleaning of the house before you arrive is included in the renting cost.

## Hot water

Hot water is available in both toilet rooms and in the kitchen, and is supplied by the water heater above the kitchen sink. The water heater is automatic, meaning it will turn on whenever a hot water tap is opened. Note that it can take a minute or so before hot water reaches the toilet room upstairs. Make sure the yellow valve is open before using hot water. Refer to the section on [gas](#gas) for more information about the gas supply.

The water heater has a safety feature which prevents operation when the carbon dioxide concentration is too high. Although the exhaust gases of the water heater are diverted outside through a dedicated conduct, it may happen during stormy or windy conditions that theses gases have difficulty flowing out, increasing the concentraction of carbon dioxide and shutting down the gas heater. If that is the case, open the kitchen window and external door (unlock it with the key hanging on the wall to the left of the door), close the internal door and wait for 10 minutes before trying again. Once the kitchen is ventilated (which fortunately happens quickly when windy), the gas heater will start working again automatically once you open a hot water tap.

There are some buttons and a dial on the water heater but they only control how hot the water gets. There is an on/off button but it should never be off.

During the summer months, due to the large influx of tourists, the public water network is in high demand and, for this reason, the water pressure may drop considerably, specially between 19:00 and 21:00, when everyone is coming back from the beach. This may make it difficult to regulate the temperature of the water in the bathtubs, specially upstairs. The problem is that, starting from full hot water, as you turn the tap towards cold water (even if done slowly and progressively) there will be a point when the pressure of the hot water drops below the minimum level that the water heater can handle, and it will cause the gas burner to shut down. This means that the water is either too hot (because insufficient cold water is mixing with the hot water) or too cold (because no hot water is flowing because the gas burner is off). Unfortunately, there isn't a good way to fix this issue because it originates in the low water pressure in the public water network. Fortunately, this problem is most significant in the bathtub upstairs, while downstairs the problem is much more manageable, partly because the hot water reaches the shower head very quickly, so it's easier to control, partly because the water pressure is higher.


# Operations

## Light switches on the ground floor

The light switches on the ground floor 50 years old. This means they sometimes might be a little stubborn to work as expected, but they are all operational. If you flick the switch and the light doesn't come on (or off), grab the small lever (the piece that moves) and wiggle it sideways. This will help release the spring inside and the switch will work as expected.

## Main water valve

On the external southern wall of the house, close to the South-western corner, there is a small white plastic panel covering the valve that turns off the water in the whole house. If you exit through the front door, turn immediately to the left, go around the corner and you should see this white plastic panel a roughly waste height.

Please contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* if you need assistance.

## Main electricity switches

On the right wall immediately after entering through the front door, there is a painting hanging on the wall. This painting is covering the electric switch board. There is a warning sign below.

The panel is divided into three sections: from left to right you will see:

1. three old-looking push buttons on top and the main electric switch on the bottom;
2. two modern-looking switches;
3. the electricity counter.

The useful part of the panel is the first one. The three push buttons, from left to right, control the following:

1. Lights and power sockets on the ground floor, except washing machines and the storage room under the stairs;
2. Washing machined;
3. Lights and power sockets on the top floor and the storage room under the stairs.

The big switch below the three push button cuts the power to the whole house.

Please contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* if you need assistance.


## Gas

The hot water, stove and oven are heated with gap (propane). The gas tube comes from a small storage room outside the kitchen, to the right of the external kitchen door (use the key hanging to the left of the kitchen door to unlock it). It enters the kitchen close to the sink and travels to the stove above the counter. On this tube you will find a couple of yellow valves. If these valves are aligned with the direction of the tube, they are open. If they are perpendicular to the direction of the tube, they are cutting the flow of gas. Be sure to open these valves before operating the stove or using the hot water.

To access the gas tanks, you simply open the door of the small storage room outside of the kitchen. Inside you will see this:

![this](http://jgte.github.io/zh/images/gas.jpg)

These are 40 litres propane tanks and they should last for a long time. At the top of the picture, you see the gas pipe going into the kitchen. It comes down through two red regulators, that make sure the gas pressure at the stove and water heater is adequate. From the bottom regulator, the pipe splits right and left, into both gas tanks. There are two yellow valves immediately after the pipe splits. The valves control which tank is supplying gas.

In case you run out of gas, chances are that the unused tank is full. All you need to do is switch the supply to that tank:

1. Close the yellow valve leading to the tank in use, i.e. the valve that is currently open (the one on the right, in the picture above). You do this by rotating the valve so that is becomes perpendicular to the pipe (like the valve on the left, in the picture above);
2. Open the yellow valve leading to the other tank.

**Do not open both valves at the same time.** This will spill gas between the tanks, making it likely that both tanks need to be replaced at the same time and possibly preventing you from having hot water for a period of time.

Please inform *Sra. Zina Sirooka* when a gas tank is empty so that she can order a new one to replace the depleted one.


# Getting there

The following instructions assume you are travelling from Lisbon. Another option is to fly to Faro and rent a car from there. Public transport from Faro to Zambujeira is not easy, since you need to do a stop-over at Lagos.

Let me know if you need help travelling form locations other than Lisbon.

## Car

1. Take the **Vasco da Gama** bridge on **A12** motorway. You can also take the **25 de Abril** bridge (the one that looks like the Golden Gate bridge in S. Francisco), but that means you need to cross Lisbon, if you're coming from the airport

2. Exit the **A12** to **A2**, following signs **Sul / Algarve**.

3. Exit **A2**, to **IP8/Sines/Santiago/Grândola**.

4. Follow **IP8** road for about 45 km until you find the section of motorway **A26**.

5. Exit the **A26** towards **St. André / Odemira**, go around the roundabout and exit towards **Algarve / Cercal / Vila Nova Milfontes**.

6. Follow the **Cercal** sign towards the second plate, which indicates **Porto Covo**.

7. Keep following the signs to **Porto Covo / Vila Nova de Milfontes**.

8. Before arriving at **Vila Nova de Milfontes**, there's a large roundabout. Follow towards South (straight, don't take the right exit, into **Vila Nova de Milfontes**). You will soon cross a large bridge with an amazing view of the mouth of river Mira.

9. Turn right at the sign **Cabo Sardão / Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer since you need to go to **Odemira**).

10. After 2 km turn left into **Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer, since you need to go to **Cavaleiro**).

11. After 5 km, you come across a junction, take the right towards **Zambujeira**. Keep going straight and ignore the left turn towards **S. Teotónio**.

12. At the end of roughly 1 km of straight road going West, you'll be in **Zambujeira**. Go straight until you can only take a right turn, towards North.

13. Take the first left turn, towards West; you should be seeing the ocean at a distance.

14. Keep going straight until you find a roundabout, take the right exit, going North.

15. After 20m, there's a crossing and one house further you'll see *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte* on the right. It's a bit confusing that the first house on the corner is nr. 3, while *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte* is further down the street and it's nr. 1. That's how things work in Alentejo sometimes.

A map of this route can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/ZKu7BLoePPE2).


## Bus

The cheapest way to get to Zambujeira is by bus. They depart from [**Sete Rios** bus terminal](https://goo.gl/maps/BkjK65p9Zmv), which is easily accessible by Lisbon's subway (which also connects directly to the airport).

The buses depart daily at:

* 7:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 8:30 (only between 15 July and 31 August)
* 10:30 (between 1 September and 20 June, only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays)
* 13:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 17:00

Be sure the check the schedules at the website of [*Rede Expressos*](http://www.rede-expressos.pt/) (the company operating the bus lines).

The bus stop in Zambujeira is [300 m away](https://goo.gl/maps/JDVFLLizMt32) from *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*.

If you know the date of your return to Lisbon, buy a return ticket, saving you some money. If you need to buy the return ticket in Zambujeira, go to [Pastelaria Doce Tentação](https://goo.gl/maps/c7x2aZApEPN2), they have a sales point there.

# Parking

Park the car on the street, in front of the house. It is not possible to park the car in the driveway south of the house. During the summer, there are many cars and it might not be easy to park in front of the house. There are, however, many parking places in the surrounding streets.

# Festival Sudoeste

At the start of August, the [Festival Sudoeste](http://www.meosudoeste.pt) takes place [2 km away](https://goo.gl/maps/tiTbq2ufZS82) from Zambujeira do Mar. It's huge! There's a tsunami of festival-goers and it's difficult to stay oblivious to this event. Restaurants are always full, the beach is over-crowded and most people who traditionally take vacations in Zambujeira go somewhere else during this period. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is not a good time to come to Zambujeira.

Check out [some pictures in Google](https://www.google.pt/search?q=festival+sudoeste&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNotn1qN7LAhUF7xQKHVnCAzEQ_AUIBygB) to get an idea of it.

# Weather


The weather during the summer is very pleasant. It never gets too hot because of the sea breeze. During the night, the temperature drops somewhat and it is rare that it remains hot enough to go outside without some kind of coat of pullover. You may wake up to find the village covered by fog. Usually, it clears out at around noon.

Be sure to join scores of people watching the sun set, it is usually quite amazing.

Outside the summer months, the weather tends to be chilly during the night, to the extent of being uncomfortable during winter. Note that there is no heating whatsoever in the *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*.
