# Safety

The village of Zambujeira do Mar is a quiet and peaceful community; robberies are very uncommon. However, during the summer, with the inflow of tourists, it is always a good idea to leave the door locked when absent from the house. Be sure to properly close all windows (including those upstairs).

Do not grant access to the house to anyone, including someone claiming to be me or to be acting on my behalf. The obvious exceptions are your host *Sra. Zina Sirooka*, who you met when you arrived (or anyone accompanying her), and the police (most likely from the [GNR](http://www.gnr.pt) *Guarda Nacional Republicana* -- National Republican Guard -- who wears [characteristic uniforms](https://www.google.pt/search?q=farda+da+guarda+nacional+republicana&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjum6Kdx97LAhWHchQKHY8ZDtYQ_AUIBygB&biw=1358&bih=650)). Less obvious is to allow access to workers from the electricity company [EDP](http://www.edp.pt), who must be wearing a uniform and able to present identification, so that they can read the electricity counter on the wall to the right, immediately after the front door. There is no need to let them any further than the hall next to the front door.

Be aware that the bathtubs (on both toilet rooms) are extremely slippery when wet. Do not climb inside without first setting the rubber mat. If the rubber mat is missing, contact *Sra. Zina Sirooka* to get a replacement.

On the toilet room of the ground floor, there is first aid supplies to the right, immediately after the front door.

# Appliances and services

* Kitchen
  * Stove and oven (gas)
  * Fridge and freezer
  * Dish washer
  * Microwave
  * Toaster
* Hot water on the kitchen and both toilets
* Washing machine (toilet room on the ground floor)
* TV (TV room)
* Coffee machine (dinning room, use [these coffee capsules](https://www.mydeltaq.com/capsulas.aspx), can be bought at the big supermarket in São Teotónio)
* Wireless (throughout the house, SSID: *Lajinha*, contact me to get the password)

# External areas

You have access to the terrace, the balcony upstairs and the yard in front of the house (between the street and the western wall of the house). The driveway on the south and the yard on the east are only for emergency. The external kitchen door leads to the eastern yard, you can find the key of the lock hanging on the wall to the left of this door. You may also access the gas storage, if needed, see the [section on operating the gas supply](#gas).

# Operations

## Dishwasher

1. Load it with dirty dishes in the usual way.
2. Put soap in the compartment (only use dishwasher soap, do not use normal soap, it makes way too much foam and it will spill all over the floor; don't ask me how I know this).
3. Close the lid of the soap compartment.
4. Close the door of the dishwasher.
5. Rotate the button on the top right until you align the mark on he button with the mark on the body. There is only this mark, since the remaining markings are worn out.
7. Turn on the power using the red switch on the multiple power sockets, which is resting on top of the dishwasher, on the far right corner. The red switch will be lit, indicating that electricity is flowing and the microwave will beep (since it too is connected to this multiple power socket). Be sure to disconnect the toaster (by yanking the respective power cord).
6. Pull the button on the dishwasher out. It should start making noises.

## Washing machine

1. Load the dirty clothes in the machine (do not over-fill it, otherwise it will not start).
2. Close the glass door.
3. Open the soap container located on the top left of the front panel.
4. Fill the soap and softener compartments, and the chlorine compartment if needed.
5. Close the soap container.
6. Connect the power cord to the power socket on the wall behind the washing machine.
7. Push the round button immediately to the right of the soap container.
8. Rotate the dial to select the appropriate washing program. Check this [picture](http://jgte.github.io/zh/images/maquina_de_lavar1.png) and this [picture](http://jgte.github.io/zh/images/maquina_de_lavar2.png), showing the meaning of the symbols printed in the washing machine (in Portuguese). Blue is for cotton clothes, yellow is for synthetic clothes and black is for woollen clothes, in decreasing order of program length and washing intensity. The time it takes to finish the program is shown on the led panel.
9. Push the small diamond-shaped button on the far right. After a couple of seconds, it should start making noises.
10. After the program finishes, turn off the machine by pressing the round button, disconnect the power cord from the power socket and open the glass door.

## Main water valve

On the external southern wall of the house, close to the South-western corner, there is a small white plastic panel covering the valve that turns off the water in the whole house. If you exit through the front door, turn immediately to the left, go around the corner and you should see this white plastic panel a roughly waste height.

## Main electricity switches

On the right wall immediately after entering through the front door, there is a painting hanging on the wall. This painting is covering the electric switch board. There is a warning sign below.

The panel is divided into three sections: from left to right you will see:

1. three old-looking push buttons on top and the main electric switch on the bottom;
2. two modern-looking switches;
3. the electricity counter.

The useful part of the panel is the first one. The three push buttons, from left to right, control the following:

1. Lights and power sockets on the ground floor, except washing machines and the storage room under the stairs;
2. Washing machined;
3. Lights and power sockets on the top floor and the storage room under the stairs.

The big switch below the three push button cuts the power to the whole house.

## Gas

The hot water, stove and oven are heated with gap (propane). The gas tube comes from a small storage room outside the kitchen, to the right of the external kitchen door (use the key hanging to the left of the kitchen door to unlock it). It enters the kitchen close to the sink and travels to the stove above the counter. On this tube you will find a couple of yellow valves. If these valves are aligned with the direction of the tube, they are open. If they are perpendicular to the direction of the tube, they are cutting the flow of gas. Be sure to open these valves before operating the stove or using the hot water.

To access the gas tanks, you simply open the door of the small storage room outside of the kitchen. Inside you will see [this](http://jgte.github.io/zh/images/gas.jpg). These are 40 litres propane tanks and they should last for a long time. In case you run out of gas, chances are that the unused tank is full. All you need to do is switch the supply to that tank:

1. Close the yellow valve leading to the tank in use, i.e. the valve that is currently open. You do this by rotating the valve so that is becomes perpendicular to the pipe (like the valve on the left, in [this](http://jgte.github.io/zh/images/gas.jpg) picture);
2. Open the yellow valve leasing to the other tank.

**Do not open both valves at the same time.** This will spill gas between the tanks, making it likely that both tanks need to be replaced at the same time and preventing you from having hot water for a period of time.

After doing this, please inform *Sra. Zina Sirooka* so that she can order a new gas tank to replace the depleted one.


# Getting there

The following instructions assume you are travelling from Lisbon. Another option is to fly to Faro and rent a car from there. Public transport from Faro to Zambujeira is not easy, since you need to do a stop-over at Lagos.

Let me know if you need help travelling form locations other than Lisbon.

## Car

1. Take the **Vasco da Gama** bridge on **A12** motorway. You can also take the **25 de Abril** bridge (the one that looks like the Golden Gate bridge in S. Francisco), but that means you need to cross Lisbon, if you're coming from the airport

2. Exit the **A12** to **A2**, following signs **Sul / Algarve**.

3. Exit **A2**, to **IP8/Sines/Santiago/Grândola**.

4. Follow **IP8** road for about 45 km until you find the section of motorway **A26**.

5. Exit the **A26** towards **St. André / Odemira**, go around the roundabout and exit towards **Algarve / Cercal / Vila Nova Milfontes**.

6. Follow the **Cercal** sign towards the second plate, which indicates **Porto Covo**.

7. Keep following the signs to **Porto Covo / Vila Nova de Milfontes**.

8. Before arriving at **Vila Nova de Milfontes**, there's a large roundabout. Follow towards South (straight, don't take the right exit, into **Vila Nova de Milfontes**). You will soon cross a large bridge with an amazing view of the mouth of river Mira.

9. Turn right at the sign **Cabo Sardão / Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer since you need to go to **Odemira**).

10. After 2 km turn left into **Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer, since you need to go to **Cavaleiro**).

11. After 5 km, you come across a junction, take the right towards **Zambujeira**. Keep going straight and ignore the left turn towards **S. Teotónio**.

12. At the end of roughly 1 km of straight road going West, you'll be in Zambujeira. Follow straight until you can only take a right turn, towards North.

13. Take the first left turn, towards West; you should be seeing the ocean at a distance.

14. Keep going straight until you find a roundabout, take the right exit, going North.

15. After 20 m, there's a crossing and one house further you'll see *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte* on the right. It's a bit confusing that the first house on the corner is nr. 3 (while *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte* is further down the street and it's nr. 1) that's how things work in Alentejo sometimes.

A map of this route can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/ZKu7BLoePPE2).


## Bus

The best way to get to Zambujeira is by bus. They depart from [**Sete Rios** bus terminal](https://goo.gl/maps/BkjK65p9Zmv), which is easily accessible by Lisbon's subway (which also connects directly to the airport).

The buses depart daily at:

* 7:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 8:30 (only between 15 July and 31 August)
* 10:30 (between 1 September and 20 June, only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays)
* 13:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 17:00

Be sure the check the schedules at the website of [*Rede Expressos*](http://www.rede-expressos.pt/) (the company operating the bus lines).

The bus stop in Zambujeira is [300 m away](https://goo.gl/maps/JDVFLLizMt32) from *Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*.


# Parking

Park the car on the street, in front of the house. It is not possible to park the car in the driveway south of the house. During the summer, there many cars and it might not be easy to park in front of the house. There are, however, many parking places in the streets surrounding.

# Festival Sudoeste

At the start of August, the [Festival Sudoeste](http://www.meosudoeste.pt) takes place [2 km away](https://goo.gl/maps/tiTbq2ufZS82) from Zambujeira do Mar. It's huge! There's a tsunami of festival-goers and it's difficult to stay oblivious to this event. Restaurants are always full, the beach is over-crowded and most people who traditionally take vacations in Zambujeira go somewhere else during this period.

Check out [some pictures in Google](https://www.google.pt/search?q=festival+sudoeste&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNotn1qN7LAhUF7xQKHVnCAzEQ_AUIBygB) to get an idea of it.
