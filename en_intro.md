# Safety

The village of Zambujeira do Mar is a quiet and peaceful community; robberies are very uncommon. However, during the summer, with the inflow of tourists, it is always a good idea to leave the door locked when absent from the house. Be sure to properly close all windows (including those upstairs).

Do not grant access to the house to anyone, including someone claiming to be me or to be acting on my behalf. The obvious exceptions are your host [*Sra. Zina Sirooka*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/desc#house-contacts), who you met when you arrived (or anyone accompanying her), and the police (most likely from the [GNR](http://www.gnr.pt) *Guarda Nacional Republicana* -- National Republican Guard -- who wears [characteristic uniforms](https://www.google.pt/search?q=farda+da+guarda+nacional+republicana&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjum6Kdx97LAhWHchQKHY8ZDtYQ_AUIBygB&biw=1358&bih=650)). Less obvious is to allow access to workers from the electricity company [EDP](http://www.edp.pt), who must be wearing a uniform and able to present identification, so that they can read the electricity counter on the wall to the right, immediately after the front door. There is no need to let them any further than the hall next to the front door.

Be aware that the bathtubs (on both toilet rooms) are extremely slippery when wet. Do not climb inside without first setting the rubber mat. If the rubber mat is missing, contact [*Sra. Zina Sirooka*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/desc#house-contacts) to get a replacement. Please use the bathtub on the other toilet room until the new rubber mat is available.

On the terrace, there is an unused water tank made of [fibrous cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos_cement), which contains a small percentage of asbestos. There is no danger to health because the asbestos fibres are sequestered inside the material. Nevertheless, damage to this water tank may cause these fibres to get loose. Therefore, do not interact any way with this water tank. Please keep an eye on small children while in the terrace.

On the toilet room of the ground floor, there is first aid supplies to the right, immediately after the front door.
