# Getting there

The following instructions assume you are travelling from Lisbon. Another option is to fly to Faro and rent a car from there. Public transport from Faro to Zambujeira is not easy, since you need to do a stop-over at Lagos.

Let me know if you need help travelling form locations other than Lisbon.

## Car

1. Take the **Vasco da Gama** bridge on **A12** motorway. You can also take the **25 de Abril** bridge (the one that looks like the Golden Gate bridge in S. Francisco), but that means you need to cross Lisbon, if you're coming from the airport

2. Exit the **A12** to **A2**, following signs **Sul / Algarve**.

3. Exit **A2**, to **IP8/Sines/Santiago/Grândola**.

4. Follow **IP8** road for about 45 km until you find the section of motorway **A26**.

5. Exit the **A26** towards **St. André / Odemira**, go around the roundabout and exit towards **Algarve / Cercal / Vila Nova Milfontes**.

6. Follow the **Cercal** sign towards the second plate, which indicates **Porto Covo**.

7. Keep following the signs to **Porto Covo / Vila Nova de Milfontes**.

8. Before arriving at **Vila Nova de Milfontes**, there's a large roundabout. Follow towards South (straight, don't take the right exit, into **Vila Nova de Milfontes**). You will soon cross a large bridge with an amazing view of the mouth of river Mira.

9. Turn right at the sign **Cabo Sardão / Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer since you need to go to **Odemira**).

10. After 2 km turn left into **Zambujeira** (going straight also works but it's a bit longer, since you need to go to **Cavaleiro**).

11. After 5 km, you come across a junction, take the right towards **Zambujeira**. Keep going straight and ignore the left turn towards **S. Teotónio**.

12. At the end of roughly 1 km of straight road going West, you'll be in **Zambujeira**. Go straight until you can only take a right turn, towards North.

13. Take the first left turn, towards West; you should be seeing the ocean at a distance.

14. Keep going straight until you find a roundabout, take the right exit, going North.

15. After 20m, there's a crossing and one house further you'll see [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address) on the right. It's a bit confusing that the first house on the corner is nr. 3, while [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address) is further down the street and it's nr. 1. That's how things work in Alentejo sometimes.

A map of this route can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/ZKu7BLoePPE2).


## Bus

The cheapest way to get to Zambujeira is by bus. They depart from [**Sete Rios** bus terminal](https://goo.gl/maps/BkjK65p9Zmv), which is easily accessible by Lisbon's subway (which also connects directly to the airport).

The buses depart daily at:

* 7:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 8:30 (only between 15 July and 31 August)
* 10:30 (between 1 September and 20 June, only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays)
* 13:30 (only between 1 July and 15 September)
* 17:00

Be sure the check the schedules at the website of [*Rede Expressos*](http://www.rede-expressos.pt/) (the company operating the bus lines).

The bus stop in Zambujeira is [300 m away](https://goo.gl/maps/JDVFLLizMt32) from [*Alojamento da Rua da Fonte*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#address), at a perfectly reasonable walking distance, even with (wheeled) luggage.

If you know the date of your return to Lisbon, buy a return ticket, saving you some money. If you need to buy the return ticket in Zambujeira, go to [Pastelaria Doce Tentação](https://goo.gl/maps/c7x2aZApEPN2), they have a sales point there.

# Parking

Park the car on the street, in front of the house. It is not possible to park the car in the driveway south of the house. During the summer, there are many cars and it might not be easy to park in front of the house. There are, however, many parking places in the surrounding streets.

# Safety

The village of Zambujeira do Mar is a quiet and peaceful community; robberies are very uncommon. However, during the summer, with the inflow of tourists, it is always a good idea to leave the door locked when absent from the house. Be sure to properly close all windows (including those upstairs).

Do not grant access to the house to anyone, including someone claiming to be me or to be acting on my behalf. The obvious exceptions are your host [*Sra. Zina Sirooka*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#house-contacts), who you met when you arrived (or anyone accompanying her), and the police (most likely from the [GNR](http://www.gnr.pt) *Guarda Nacional Republicana* -- National Republican Guard -- who wears [characteristic uniforms](https://www.google.pt/search?q=farda+da+guarda+nacional+republicana&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjum6Kdx97LAhWHchQKHY8ZDtYQ_AUIBygB&biw=1358&bih=650)). Less obvious is to allow access to workers from the electricity company [EDP](http://www.edp.pt), who must be wearing a uniform and able to present identification, so that they can read the electricity counter on the wall to the right, immediately after the front door. There is no need to let them any further than the hall next to the front door.

Be aware that the bathtubs (on both toilet rooms) are extremely slippery when wet. Do not climb inside without first setting the rubber mat. If the rubber mat is missing, contact [*Sra. Zina Sirooka*](http://jgte.github.io/zh/en/intro#house-contacts) to get a replacement. Please use the bathtub on the other toilet room until the new rubber mat is available.

On the terrace, there is an unused water tank made of [fibrous cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos_cement), which contains a small percentage of asbestos. There is no danger to health because the asbestos fibres are sequestered inside the material. Nevertheless, damage to this water tank may cause these fibres to get loose. Therefore, do not interact any way with this water tank. Please keep an eye on small children while in the terrace.

On the toilet room of the ground floor, there is first aid supplies to the right, immediately after the front door.
